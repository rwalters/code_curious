# Code Curious

I will be posting a series of articles exploring programming, assuming no previous experience on the reader's part. My hope is that a reader will be able to use this as a [primer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(textbook)), a seed of how to start programming. I do not expect to be exhaustive, and there will be much googling on the part of the reader, but hopefully I can mark a path through the overgrown jungle of information out there.

I will use [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)) for all examples, unless some contrasting code is necessary.
